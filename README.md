# Incandescent

Taking inspiration from Dani's [Fair 'n Square](https://danidev.itch.io/fair-n-square) and Askiisoft's [Katana:ZERO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/460950/Katana_ZERO/), **Incandescent** is a 2d side-view focused on frame-perfect inputs in which you try to survive the bad guys and take back your cat.

## Description

For the 2<sup>nd</sup> game at Company<sup>TM</sup>, this project should showcase the company's programming, designing and polishing expertise. Thus I have decided to choose a genre allowing me to focus on exactly that, and throw art, my weak-point, under the rug.

This should also serve as one of the first fully finished prototypes / games, as all the previous demos have been ... unpolished to say the least.
